# Fitness-Pal

## Description

We wanted to make an interative fitness tracker website. If you find it hard to remember your workouts or even want to plan ahead you can use Fitness Pal. Fitness Pal lets users login and keep a record of their workouts. A user can add specific workouts to a calender and go back to them whenever. This app fixes the problem of needing a place to store workout data. I learned a lot on how to work together as a team and how to create a full stack application. I worked a lot on a lot of the backend of the app and learned a ton on how to create and work databases and servers.
